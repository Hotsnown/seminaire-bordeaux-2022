    "In the previous chapter we wrote a function to tokenize or split a text string into a list of words. However, using this function we lose information about where sentences end and start in the text. We will develop a function split_sentences that performs some very simple sentence splitting when passed a text string. Each sentence will be represented as a new string, so the function as a whole returns a list of sentence strings. We assume that any occurrence of either . or ! or ? marks the end of a sentence. In reality, this is more ambiguous of course. Consider for example the use of periods as end-of-sentence marker as well as in abbreviations and initials!\n",

If we come up with a way to extract those indexes, we could slice the text into separate sentences. First we define a utility function end_of_sentence that takes as argument a character and returns True if it is an end-of-sentence marker, otherwise it returns False."

    "The function split_sentences takes as argument a text represented by a simple string. Within the function we define a variable sentences in which we will store the individual sentences. We need to extract both the start position and the end position of each sentence. We know that the first sentence will always start at position 0. Therefore we define a variable start and set it to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will use enumerate to loop over all individual characters in the text. Remember that enumerate returns pairs of indexes and their corresponding elements (here characters). For each character we check whether it is an end-of-sentence marker. If it is, the variable end marks the position in text where a sentence ends. We can now slice the text from the starting position to the end position and obtain our sentence. Notice that we add 1 to the end position. Why would that be? This is because, as you might remember from the first chapter, slices are non-inclusive, so text[start:end] would return the text starting at start and ending one position before end. Since we have reached the end of a sentence, we know that the next sentence will start at least one position later than our last end point. Therefore, we update the start variable to end + 1. Let's check whether our function works as promised:\n",
