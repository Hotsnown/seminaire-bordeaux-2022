    "### Agenda\n",
    "* What is the purpose of model evaluation, and what are some common evaluation procedures?\n",
    "* What is the usage of classification accuracy, and what are its limitations?\n",
    "* How does a confusion matrix describe the performance of a classifier?\n",
    "* What metrics can be computed from a confusion matrix?\n",
    "* How can you adjust classifier performance by changing the classification threshold?\n",
    "* What is the purpose of an ROC curve?\n",
    "* How does Area Under the Curve (AUC) differ from classification accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review of model evaluation\n",
    "* Need a way to choose between models: different model types, tuning parameters, and features\n",
    "* Use a model evaluation procedure to estimate how well a model will generalize to out-of-sample data\n",
    "* Requires a model evaluation metric to quantify the model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model evaluation procedures\n",
    "1. Training and testing on the same data\n",
    "    * Rewards overly complex models that \"overfit\" the training data and won't necessarily generalize\n",
    "2. Train/test split\n",
    "    * Split the dataset into two pieces, so that the model can be trained and tested on different data\n",
    "    * Better estimate of out-of-sample performance, but still a \"high variance\" estimate\n",
    "    * Useful due to its speed, simplicity, and flexibility\n",
    "3. K-fold cross-validation\n",
    "    * Systematically create \"K\" train/test splits and average the results together\n",
    "    * Even better estimate of out-of-sample performance\n",
    "    * Runs \"K\" times slower than train/test split\n",
    "\n",
